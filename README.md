This repository includes all files used in an "Analysis of Model Sloppiness" course I prepared/presented for higher degree research students in 2023.

It contains:

-> Python code examples, as Jupyter Notebooks

-> Slides (as one PDF file), describing the course

-> Video of Sequential Monte Carlo sampling (linked from the slides)

Using this code it is possible to do maximum likelihood estimation, Sequential Monte Carlo sampling, and analysis of sloppiness in Python!

If you use this code and wish to cite it, the most appropriate reference would likely be:

Analysis of sloppiness in model simulations: unveiling parameter uncertainty when mathematical models are fitted to data. Science Advances, Vol. 8, Paper eabm5952.

Thank you and I hope this code is useful to you in some way. :) Any questions, feel free to email me (mp.adams@qut.edu.au).
